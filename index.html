      <div class="container">

        <div class="card">
          <h3>JavaScript (JS)</h3>
          <p>JS is a dynamic computer programming language. It is most commonly used as part of Web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Operators</h3>
          <p>JavaScript has both strict and type converting comparisons. A strict comparison (e.g., ===) is only true if the operands are of the same type.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Variables</h3>
          <p>JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Functions</h3>
          <p>A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses (). Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Methods</h3>
          <p>JavaScript methods are the actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Arguments</h3>
          <p>The arguments object is an Array-like object corresponding to the arguments passed to a function.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Parameters</h3>
          <p>A JavaScript function does not perform any checking on parameter values (arguments).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Return</h3>
          <p>When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing. If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement. Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller".</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Chaining</h3>
          <p>Method chaining is a technique that can be used to simplify code in scenarios that involve calling multiple functions on the same object consecutively. This is an example of how you can use method chaining when using jQuery.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Strings</h3>
          <p>A JavaScript string stores a series of characters like "John Doe".</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Booleans</h3>
          <p>A JavaScript Boolean represents one of two values: true or false.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Undefined</h3>
          <p>The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value.NaN is a property of the global object. The initial value of NaN is Not-A-Number — the same as the value of Number.NaN . In modern browsers, NaN is a non-configurable, non-writable property. Even when this is not the case, avoid overriding it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>NaN</h3>
          <p>NaN is a property of the global object. The initial value of NaN is Not-A-Number — the same as the value of Number.NaN . In modern browsers, NaN is a non-configurable, non-writable property. Even when this is not the case, avoid overriding it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Escape</h3>
          <p>The escape() function encodes a string. This function makes a string portable, so it can be transmitted across any network to any computer that supports ASCII characters.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Alert</h3>
          <p>An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user. When an alert box pops up, the user will have to click "OK" to proceed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Comments</h3>
          <p>To create a single line comment in JavaScript, you place two slashes "//" in front of the code or text you wish to have the JavaScript interpreter ignore. When you place these two slashes, all text to the right of them will be ignored, until the next line.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>jQuery</h3>
          <p>jQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library in use today, with installation on 65% of the top 10 million highest-trafficked sites on the Web.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Attributes</h3>
          <p>The getAttribute() method returns the value of the attribute with the specified name, of an element. Use the getAttributeNode() method if you want to return the attribute as an Attr object.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
